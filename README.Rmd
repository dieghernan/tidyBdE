**tidyBdE** is a API package that helps to retrieve data from [Banco de Espa침a](hhttps://www.bde.es/webbde/en/estadis/infoest/descarga_series_temporales.html). 
The data is provided as [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) and the package
tries to guess the format of every time-series (dates, characters and numbers)


## Installation

You can install the developing version of **tidyBdE** with:

``` r

library(remotes)
install_github("dieghernan/tidyBdE")
```

## Examples

Banco de Espa침a (**BdE**) provides several time-series, either produced by the institution itself or compiled for another sources, as [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat) or [INE](https://www.ine.es/).

The basic entry point for searching time-series are the catalogs, (*indexes*) of information:

```{r search}
library(tidyBdE)

# Search USD on "TC" (exchange rate) catalog
XR_USD <- bde_catalog_search("USD", catalog="TC")

XR_USD[c(2,5)]


```

Now, we can load the series for the USD/EUR exchange rate using the sequential number reference (`Numero_Secuencial`) as:

```{r find}
# Load tidyverse for better handling
library(tidyverse)

time_series <- bde_series_load(573234, series_label = "EUR_USD_XR") %>%
  filter(Date >= "2010-01-01" & Date <= "2015-12-31") %>%
  drop_na()

```
The package also provides a custom `ggplot2` theme based on the publications of BdE:

```{r chart, fig.asp=0.7}


ggplot(time_series) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = EUR_USD_XR), colour = bde_vivid_pal()(1)) +
  labs(title = "EUR/USD Exchange Rate (2010-2015)",
       subtitle = "%",
       caption = "Source: BdE") +
  theme_bde() 

```

The package provides also several "shortcut" functions for a selection
of the most relevant macroeconomic series, so there is no need to look for them
in advance:

```{r macroseries, fig.asp=0.7}

gdp <- bde_ind_gdp_var("values")
gdp$label <- "GDP YoY"

UnempRate <- bde_ind_unemployment_rate("values")
UnempRate$label <- "Unemployment Rate"

plotseries <- bind_rows(gdp, UnempRate) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  filter(Date >= "2010-01-01" & Date <= "2019-12-31")

ggplot(plotseries, aes(x = Date, y = values)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = label)) +
  labs(title = "Spanish Economic Indicators (2010-2019)",
       subtitle = "%",
       caption = "Source: BdE") +
  theme_bde() +
  bde_scale_color_vivid()

```


### A note on caching

You can use **tidyBdE** to create your own local repository at a given local directory passing the following option:

```r
options(bde_cache_dir = "./path/to/location")
```

When this option is set, **tidyBdE** would look for the cached file and it will load it, speeding up the process.

It is possible to update the data (i.e. after every monthly or quaterly data release) with the following command:

```r

bde_catalog_update()

# On specific series use the option update_cache = TRUE

bde_series_load("SOME ID", update_cache = TRUE)

```

## Another R packages for downloading Spanish open data

Other useful packages that provides access to Spanish open data:
- [**opendataes**](https://ropenspain.github.io/opendataes/): A package that downloads data from the <https://datos.gob.es> API.
- [**MicroDatosEs**](https://github.com/rOpenSpain/MicroDatosEs): A package that process microdata provided by Spanish statistical agencies (mostly, INE).
- [**CatastRo**](https://github.com/rOpenSpain/CatastRo): A package that queries to query Sede electr칩nica del Catastro API.
